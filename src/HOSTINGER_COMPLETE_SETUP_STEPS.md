Supabase Dashboard → Edge Functions → Logs
Look for error messages (lines with ❌)

- Email address must be FULL: `noreply@animedropzone.com`
- Password must be EXACT match (copy-paste if possible)
- No extra spaces

**Check 3: SMTP Authentication**
In Hostinger hPanel:
- Go to **Emails** → Your email → **Manage**
- Make sure IMAP/SMTP is **ENABLED**
- If disabled, click **Enable** and save

**Check 4: Email Password Reset**
1. Hostinger hPanel → **Emails** → **Manage**
2. Click **Change Password**
3. Create NEW strong password
4. Copy the NEW password
5. Update HOSTINGER_SMTP_PASS in Supabase with NEW password

### Error: "Authentication Failed"
- Wrong email or password
- IMAP/SMTP not enabled in Hostinger
- See "Check 3" and "Check 4" above

### Error: "Connection Refused"
- SMTP server address wrong (should be `smtp.hostinger.com`)
- SMTP port wrong (try 465 for SSL or 587 for TLS)
- Firewall/network issue (unlikely)

### Emails Going to Spam?
- This is normal initially
- Wait a few days - deliverability will improve
